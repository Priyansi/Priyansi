## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am Priyansi, a CS undergrad at [KIIT](https://kiit.ac.in/) and an INTJ navigating through life by making lists. I code in Python and C++. My love for Maths made me explore Deep Learning as a 2020 resolution and I haven't looked back since.

### Whatcha upto? ðŸ‘©ðŸ’»
- Exploring MLOps as I intern @Fynd.
- Improving PyTorch-Ignite's docs.
- Learning to write clean and modern C++ code.
