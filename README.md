## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am Priyansi, a CS undergrad at [KIIT](https://kiit.ac.in/) and an INTJ navigating through life by making lists. I code in Python, C and C++. My love for Maths made me explore Deep Learning as a 2020 resolution and I haven't looked back since.

### Whatcha upto? ðŸ‘©ðŸ’»
- Learning to write clean and modern C++ code. 
- Exploring Deep Learning through projects like [Image Colourisation](https://github.com/Priyansi/Image-Colourisation-Project) 
- Collaborating with a fellow [colleague](https://github.com/junaidrahim) on a C tutorial series available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT-AS3Wcy-pkPo1ECXgh1QZCor7CwqQDw)
