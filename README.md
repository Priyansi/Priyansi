## Hey there 👋

I am Priyansi, a CS undergrad at [KIIT](https://kiit.ac.in/) and an INTJ navigating through life by making lists.

I’ve loved computers ever since I crashed my first one, then fixed it up. To this day, I don’t remember how I did it, but I do remember the joy after solving something that was basically an enigma for a 12-year-old. Since then I've always chased the adrenaline rush of solving problems. I used to be a jack of all trades jumping from language to language until I found solace in Python. My love for Maths made me explore Deep Learning as a 2020 resolution and I haven't looked back since.

### Whatcha upto? 👩💻
Getting through the pandemic on chai and code for I have my hands in a lot of things from modern C++ to PyTorch and fastai. I'm also collaborating with a fellow [colleague](https://github.com/junaidrahim) on a C tutorial series available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT-AS3Wcy-pkPo1ECXgh1QZCor7CwqQDw). Also it's completely natural for me to drop everything for a day or two and get involved in a completely new project like a Telegram Bot or Fake Twitter.

### We can talk about 💬
- Coding concepts if you're stuck somewhere. I'd be happy to help.
- Deep philosophical questions or conspiracy theories if you're feeling lucky.
